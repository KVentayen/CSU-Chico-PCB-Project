# Video Reference
The tutorial assembled for this project derive from [KiCad STM32 + USB + Buck Converter PCB Design and JLCPCB Assembly (Update) - Phil's Lab #11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7-8nUU6e3E) by [Phil's Lab](https://www.youtube.com/@PhilsLab) on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com)

# Promotional
This workshop may be of interest to the following clubs, organizations, or affiliations
- Senior Capstone Electrical and Computer Engineering
- Senior Capstone Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering
- Intitute of Elecrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
- AIME
- Wildcat Racing
- Wildcat Formula
- Chico Rocketry and Aerospace Club
- General Electrical and Computer Engineering Classes
- Mechanical Keyboard Club

# Equiptment
## Development
When using KiCad it would be a good idea for students to have the following:
- Computer Mouse
    - It would be a good idea for the speed of assembling circuits
- Charger
    - Just depends on the student's computer's battery life and how much it is used
    - This also means that we would need outlets for everyone who would need to charge their device

# Basic Knowledge
It would be a good idea to ensure that students know the following concepts:
- Nodes (as used in circuits)
    - This is to apply the concept to symbols such as:
        - Global Labels
        - Ground Reference
        - +5V Power Supply
        - +3.3V Power Supply
- Resistor Combinations
    - Calculate Resistors in Parallel
    - Calculate Resistors in Series

# Additional Topics
This is a list of additional topics that would be nice to cover aswell
- EasyEDA: To get more components in to KiCad

# Bill of Materials

## Equiptment
- Soldering Iron
- Third Hand (Hold the Board while soldering)
- Fume Extractor
- Wire Cutters
- Wire Strippers
- Solder Sucker
- Needlenose Pliers
